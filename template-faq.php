		<h3>From the author</h3>
		<p>Hey, I'm <a href="http://mattdowney.co">Matt Downey</a>, nice to meet you! I'm a web designer by day and audio enthusiast by night. I created <a href="<?php bloginfo('wpurl'); ?>">ProTones</a> because I was unhappy with the stock ringtones that ship with the iPhone and wanted something unique.</p>

		<p>If you have any questions about these ringtones, please feel free to <a href="http://twitter.com/mattdowney">hit me up on Twitter</a> or <a href="http://eepurl.com/cfubaD">sign up for the newsletter</a> to be updated when new premium iPhone ringtones are released. Cheers!</p>
